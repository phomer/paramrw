				Random walk TODO
======================================================================================

- put text on the images
- use bigger pallets, that show collisions better (darker for more collisions)

- Put on github?
- make into parameter library? Specify distributed param? How do I bound this?

- teleports in 1D? (can we implement a time based teleport, so it kicks in over a period? Maybe model stocks?)
	- the idea is that irrational events randomly push the walk in a bigger direction, until they are exhausted.

- how does this relate to weiner functions?
